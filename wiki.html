        <p><b>Who invented television</b></p>

        <p>No single inventor deserves credit for the television. The idea was floating around long before the technology existed to make it happen, and many scientists and engineers made contributions that built on each other to eventually produce what we know as TV today.Television’s origins can be traced to the 1830s and ‘40s, when Samuel F.B. Morse developed the telegraph, the system of sending messages (translated into beeping sounds) along wires. Another important step forward came in 1876 in the form of Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone, which allowed the human voice to travel through wires over long distances.</p>

<p><b>Importance of television</b></p>

<p>Today it is very common in industrialized countries for a household to have at least one television. In fact, it is so common that it is difficult to imagine a household without TV. This shows just how important television is. To understand how important television is, we can look at the variety of programs and valuable content it offers and the purposes it serves in daily life.</p>

<p>First of all, there are many different types of programs on television. The viewer can watch a weather report to prepare for the day. Cartoons and sport provide relaxation and fun. School programs, documentaries and the news teach us about the world. And advertisements inform us about products and new ideas.</p>

<p>Secondly, the content is very appealing because it is realistic and up to date. As TV is a medium that combines moving, color images and sound, it resembles real life, so the viewers can identify with what they see. Furthermore, modern technology means that the content is up to date, for example, news reports can be broadcast live and from all over the world.</p>

<p>Finally, TV can be used to enhance many important aspects of everyday life. People seek entertainment and distraction, and TV can give us that in the form of films or cartoons. People want education, information and instruction because they are inquisitive and like to learn. TV gives us this in documentaries or educational programs, and in reports or cultural programs. It introduces us to knowledge.</p>

<p><b>How television changed the world</b></p>

<p>TV is a constant presence in most Americans' lives. With its fast-moving, visually interesting, highly entertaining style, it commands many people's attention for several hours each day. Studies have shown that television competes with other sources of human interaction—such as family, friends, church, and school—in helping young people develop values and form ideas about the world around them. It also influences viewers' attitudes and beliefs about themselves, as well as about people from other social, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.</p>

<p>It played an important role in the political process, particularly in shaping national election campaign. Finally, television helped to spread American culture around the world.</p>

 <p><b>What does the television do</b></p>

<p>The television allows us to watch things from around the world without going to that placr to watch that thing. We just have to press a button and then we can watch anything we want on the television.</p>
